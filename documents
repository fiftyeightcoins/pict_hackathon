initializrion of backend, mongo as a db,routes initiazlied,models initialized,separete frontend and backend
	
The whole project will be require atleast three server:
     1)frontend
     2)backend
     3)ml

Front end and backend will be using different servers to simplify the project, also free web hosting platforms doesnt allow any live changes on server - ie we cannot add or delete or update anything on the server


Here the backend basically includes:

  Models 
	To deine the user schema extaly what all info is associated with the user 

 Database used is mongo (in the project i have used the local mongo db, but i will
  update it later by using a online db)

Routes:

Till now, tehre routes
Home route 
Adduser
Listuser
login

Will will modify it according to our future req
